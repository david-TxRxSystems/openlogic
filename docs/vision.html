    <h1>Our Vision</h1>
    <p><strong>OpenLogic</strong> is building the future of Smart Home programming — a modern, open, and transparent platform for professional integrators who want flexibility, power, and control.</p>

    <p>We believe Smart Homes shouldn't be locked down by proprietary platforms. Integrators deserve tools that work for them, not against them. Tools that are readable, maintainable, portable, and adaptable. Tools that scale with the complexity of high-end homes without getting in the way.</p>

    <p>We are inspired by the best ideas from SIMPL+, but we’re pushing things further — with structured signals, clean syntax, modular architecture, and support for custom logic and user interfaces on any device.</p>

    <p>This is more than a control system. It’s a movement toward <strong>open, programmable homes</strong> that empower integrators and delight clients.</p>
