    <h1>Our Vision</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Why OpenLogic Exists</h2>
      <p>Smart home platforms today are too often proprietary, rigid, and closed off. Integrators are locked into ecosystems that limit their creativity, slow down deployment, and prevent meaningful customization. OpenLogic exists to change that.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Who It's For</h2>
      <p>We built OpenLogic for professional integrators, developers, and forward-thinking system designers. Whether you're moving on from SIMPL+ or looking to unify your smart home stack, OpenLogic provides a foundation you can truly build on.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What We're Building</h2>
      <p>At its core, OpenLogic is a signal-based logic engine — a powerful DSL, a runtime for executing logic, and a UI framework for designing professional interfaces. But it's also a platform for integrations, a protocol hub, and a bridge between legacy and modern control systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Future We're Working Toward</h2>
      <p>We envision a world where integrators own their workflows. Where smart homes are programmable and composable. Where UI/UX is beautiful, flexible, and portable. And where the best ideas come not from a walled garden — but from the community.</p>
