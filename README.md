# OpenLogic

**OpenLogic** is a professional-grade, open-source smart home operating system designed to replace proprietary platforms like Crestron. Built with integrators in mind, it offers a declarative logic model, modular design, and compatibility with industry standards — all in an open, extensible framework.

---

## 🎯 Vision

- 🔧 Replace proprietary control systems (Crestron, AMX) with a powerful open platform  
- ✍️ Build using a clean, modern DSL inspired by SIMPL+  
- 🌐 Integrate with Home Assistant and standard I/O platforms  
- 📊 Deliver a visual programming environment for logic-based control  
- 🤝 Encourage collaboration from the integrator and open source communities  

---

## 🧱 Core Architecture

- Modular file-based project system (`.dsl` modules)
- Declarative input/output signal architecture
- Event-driven logic blocks (`when`, `pulse`, `on rising`, etc.)
- Visual programming interface (coming soon)
- Designed to run inside containers or Linux VMs
