# 📢 OpenLogic Marketing & Promotion Strategy

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Build awareness** among professional integrators and developers  
2. **Position OpenLogic as the trusted alternative to proprietary control systems**  
3. **Grow a loyal community** of early adopters and contributors  
4. **Drive interest in consulting/support services under TxRxSystems**  
5. **Lay the groundwork for future commercial offerings (hardware, support tiers)**

## 🔑 Key Messaging Pillars

| Theme | What It Communicates |
|-------|-----------------------|
| 🧠 **Professional-grade** | Built by and for experienced integrators |
| 🔓 **Open and Transparent** | No black boxes — inspect, fork, build |
| 🧱 **Modular & Scalable** | Works for rooms, estates, and everything in between |
| 🛠 **Integrator-Centric** | You’re in control — not the vendor |
| 🧭 **Independent & Community-Driven** | No lock-in, no roadmap gatekeeping |
