# OpenLogic ‚Äì Project Vision

**OpenLogic** is a professional-grade, open-source smart home operating system created for experienced integrators and developers. It aims to blend the flexibility of traditional logic programming with the ease of modern visual tools ‚Äî while maintaining transparency, extensibility, and community ownership.

## üéØ Why OpenLogic?

For years, integrators have been forced to choose between:

- **Locked-down platforms** like Crestron Home or Control4: fast to deploy, but frustratingly rigid.
- **Legacy tools** like SIMPL Windows: powerful, but slow, manual, and outdated.

**OpenLogic offers a better way:**

- ‚úÖ Start with a powerful configuration wizard that creates your project structure
- ‚úÖ Build reusable modules in a clean DSL
- ‚úÖ Wire your logic visually ‚Äî or drop into code
- ‚úÖ Extend your system with a growing library of modules and device bridges

---

## üß± The Architecture

- **Modular DSL**: Rooms, Audio, HVAC, Lighting, UI ‚Äî each their own reusable component
- **Logic Symbol Library**: Drop-in modules for common control tasks
- **Built-in Bridges**: Home Assistant, Lutron, Sonos, Spotify, and more
- **UI Designer**: Create beautiful, responsive touchscreen layouts in a browser
- **Community Powered**: Shared modules, themes, and tools evolve with your needs

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Setup Wizard**: Define your project (floors, rooms, devices)
2. **Auto-Wiring**: Generate Room + Device modules and signal connections
3. **Visual Editor**: Wire signals via drag-and-drop or write `.dsl` logic
4. **Deploy Anywhere**: Runs in Docker, Linux, Pi, NUC, or VM

---

## üí° Philosophy

- **Open, inspectable logic**
- **Professional-grade tooling**
- **Rapid onboarding**
- **Built for real-world installs**
- **Runs lean and fast on modern Linux**

This is the future of integrator-driven smart home control.

Explore it. Extend it. Make it yours.
