# ðŸ§© UI Designer

This folder is reserved for development of the OpenLogic visual UI Designer.

## Vision

The UI Designer will be a browser-based tool for laying out user interfaces that connect to OpenLogic modules.

## Goals

- Drag-and-drop interface designer
- Auto-wire signals to logic modules
- Room-based layout model
- Component library (buttons, sliders, scene panels)
- Preview panel for touch/tablet/web

## Milestones

- [ ] UI Component System
- [ ] JSON-based UI layout files
- [ ] Signal binding to logic layer
- [ ] Scene editor integration
- [ ] Web runtime module

This folder will eventually include:

- `components/` â€” reusable UI controls
- `ui_runtime/` â€” rendering and interaction logic
- `editor/` â€” WYSIWYG layout tool
