# 📁 OpenLogic Project File Structure

Each project has a main DSL file:

- `main.dsl` — root logic wiring file
- `/03_Modules/` — contains reusable modules
- `/00_Project Vision/` — purpose and goals
- `/01_Roadmap/` — task planning and milestones

Future: a `.logicproj` file for visual editor state and metadata
