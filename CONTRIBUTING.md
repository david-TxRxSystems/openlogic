# Contributing to OpenLogic

We welcome contributions to OpenLogic â€” from bug fixes and feature ideas to full-blown modules.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo and create your branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes, commit, and push:
   ```bash

   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```

3. Open a pull request and describe your changes.

## Guidelines
